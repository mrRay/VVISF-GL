//! Buffer pools create and manage GL resources which, on deletion, are either destroyed or returned to the pool for re-use.
/*!
\ingroup VVGL_BASIC

Notes on use:
- GLBufferPool creates GLBuffer/GLBufferRef instances.  You need a GLBufferPool to create a GLBuffer.  If you're using VVGL you're almost certainly going to want to create a buffer pool.
- For convenience, VVGL defines a singleton global buffer pool that you should create while your app is launching and setting up its OpenGL environment using CreateGlobalBufferPool().  The pool can be retrieved later using GetGlobalBufferPool().  It is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that you create this global buffer pool- if you don't then you'll need to explicitly pass the pool you want to use to the various buffer creation functions.
- GLBufferPool has a member function that creates buffers- but you probably shouldn't use it directly.  Instead, you should use one of the buffer creation functions in (\ref VVGL_BUFFERCREATE).
- Don't forget to call the housekeeping() member function on your buffer pools periodically!
- GLBufferPool requires a GL context on creation- the pool maintains a strong ref to this context, and will use it to create/destroy GL resources unless instructed otherwise via the "createInCurrentContext" variable in the various buffer creation functions.

\param inTexTarget The texture target of the OpenGL texture (GLBuffer::Target)
\param inTexIntFmt The internal format of the OpenGL texture.  Not as important to get right, used primarily for creating the texture.
\param inTexPxlFmt The pixel format of the OpenGL texture.  Not as important to get right, used primarily for creating the texture.
\param inTexPxlType The pixel type of the OpenGL texture.  Not as important to get right, used primarily for creating the texture.
\param inTexSize The Size of the OpenGL texture, in pixels.
\param inTexFlipped Whether or not the image in the OpenGL texture is flipped.
\param inImgRectInTex The region of the texture (bottom-left origin, in pixels) that contains the image.
\param inReleaseCallbackContext An arbitrary pointer stored (weakly) with the GLBuffer- this pointer is passed to the release callback.  If you want to store a pointer from another SDK, this is the appropriate place to do so.
\param inReleaseCallback A callback function or lambda that will be executed when the GLBuffer is deallocated.  If the GLBuffer needs to release any other resources when it's freed, this is the appropriate place to do so.
